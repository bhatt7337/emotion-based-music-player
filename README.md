# Emotion Based Music Player

This application uses Microsoft Cognitive Emotion Detection API to detect the emotion on your face. With the current status of emotion it will open a playlist of songs which you have already saved to play accordingly to your emotions.

## Getting Started

You'll need to clone this project and you have to change the subscription keys by yourself to have fully funtional application. As Microsoft gives Emotion API free for only 30 days, this application will be obsolete by few days.
To try it by yourself, look into the link in the prerequisities.
